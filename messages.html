               <p>THE MYSTERY OF THE BREACH IN THE BEAUTY:</p>
                <p>DEALING WITH THE STRENGTH KILLER</p>
           EFERENCES: ROMANS 8:11, ISAIAH 7:5-7, ISAIAH 22:9-7, I JOHN 5:20-21, EPHESIANS 4:27, JOHN 14:30
     </h4>
     <h4><p>Every breach in your life is a strength killer.</p>
      <p>  Every error - in career, marriage, destiny- kills strength. Just as breaches weaken the integrity of a building,<br> they also exist in your life to weaken you by killing your strength.</p>
           <a href="https://biblia.com/books/ws-0-1/Ro8.11">Rom 8: 11</a>
      <p>But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies<br> by his Spirit
        that dwelleth in you.</p>

          <p>There is the spirit of him who used wicked hands to kill Jesus.<a href="https://biblia.com/books/ws-0-1/Ac2.23">(Acts 2:23)</a>.<br>There is the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead…</p>
          <p> God puts His Spirit in you in order to quicken you.</p>
         He quickens your body by His Spirit in you.
        <p> When you are born again, you have His Spirit in your spirit. Your body must also receive that Spirit, so that He can quicken- revive and strengthen- it.</p>
        <p>The devil also seeks to put his spirit in your body. However, while God’s Spirit quickens your body, the devil works to weaken your body by his spirit within you.</p>
        <p>The devil knows that his spirit cannot get to your spirit (since your spirit is already born of God), so he works to get his spirit into your body, and kill its strength.
       <p>This means that both God and the devil are looking for a space in your body.</p>
          <P>A life in which God dwells will be full of life, strength, fire, and power. When His Spirit is in your body, you will enjoy a vigorous prayer life.
          <p>It is therefore your responsibility to deny the devil, and his weakening agenda- sin, sickness, prayerless-ness, powerlessness- any space in your body.
         <P><a href="https://biblia.com/books/ws-0-1/Is7.5">Isa 7:5-7</a>
          <P>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel against thee, saying, let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal
          <p>These adversaries knew that they could not achieve their evil agenda until there was a breach.
          <p>Until there is a breach in your life, the enemy cannot get his spirit into your life. He therefore looks out for an unguarded moment of error in your life, by which you give space to his spirit in you.</h4>
